# Welcome to My New Blog Post

This is a sample blog post that demonstrates the use of a banner image and the PostBanner layout. The banner image is specified in the frontmatter of this Markdown file.

## What's Different?

In the frontmatter of this post, we've added two important elements:

1. `images: ['/static/images/sample-banner.jpg']` - This specifies the banner image to be used.
2. `layout: PostBanner` - This tells the blog to use the PostBanner layout for this post.

## Rest of the Post

The rest of your post content goes here. You can use all the Markdown features as usual, such as:

- Lists
- **Bold text**
- *Italic text*
- [Links](https://example.com)
- And more!

Remember to actually add the image file `sample-banner.jpg` to your `/static/images/` directory for this to work properly.
